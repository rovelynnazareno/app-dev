# Overview
"Twilight" introduces us to Bella Swan, a teenage girl who moves to the small town of Forks, Washington, and falls in love with Edward Cullen, a vampire. Their romance faces obstacles from both the supernatural world and human society as they navigate their feelings while battling rival vampire clans.

## Plot Summary
Seventeen-year-old Bella Swan leaves Phoenix, Arizona and moves to Forks, a small town located on Washington state's Olympic Peninsula, to live with her father, Charlie, the town's police chief. Her mother, Renée, is remarried to Phil, a minor league baseball player.

Bella becomes re-acquainted with Jacob Black, a Native American teen who lives with his father, Billy, on the Quileute Indian Reservation near Forks. At school, she finds the mysterious and aloof Cullen siblings particularly intriguing. She is seated next to Edward Cullen in biology class, but he seems repulsed by her.

When Bella is nearly struck by a van in the school parking lot, Edward instantaneously covers a distance of over thirty feet to put himself between her and the van, stopping it with only his hand. He refuses to explain his actions to her, warning her against befriending him. Jacob tells Bella about a long-standing animosity between the Cullens and the Quileutes; the Cullens are not allowed on the reservation.

After Edward mysteriously saves Bella a second time, after research she concludes that he is a vampire. He eventually confirms this, explaining that he found her scent irresistible back in biology class, and that the Cullens only consume animal blood.

The pair fall in love, and he introduces her to his vampire family. Carlisle Cullen, the patriarch, is a doctor at the Forks hospital. Esme is his wife, and Alice, Jasper, Emmett, and Rosalie are their informally-adopted children. The family's reaction to Bella is mixed, concerned that the family's secret could be exposed.

Edward and Bella's relationship is jeopardized when three nomadic vampires—James, Victoria, and Laurent—arrive, responsible for a series of deaths being investigated as animal attacks. James, a tracker vampire, is excited by Bella's scent and becomes obsessed with hunting her for sport. The Cullens protect Bella, but James tracks her to Phoenix, where she is hiding with Jasper and Alice, and lures her into a trap at her old ballet studio.

James attacks Bella and infects her with vampire venom. The Cullens arrive and kill James, decapitating and burning him, as Edward removes the venom from Bella's wrist, preventing her from becoming a vampire.

In the aftermath, Edward accompanies an injured Bella to prom, where he refuses her request to transform her into a vampire. They are unaware that James' mate, Victoria, is watching them, plotting revenge for her lover's death.

# Overview
In "New Moon," Bella's world is shattered when Edward leaves her to protect her from the dangers of his world. She finds solace in her friendship with Jacob Black, a werewolf, while uncovering secrets about her own past. This installment delves deeper into the complexities of love, loss, and self-discovery.

## Plot Summary
In Forks, Washington, on Bella Swan's eighteenth birthday, she awakens from a dream in which she is an old woman and Edward Cullen, her immortal vampire boyfriend, is forever young.

Edward's family hosts a birthday reception for Bella at their home. After she receives a paper cut and is almost attacked by a bloodthirsty Jasper Cullen, Edward realizes he has put her life in danger by putting her amidst vampires. He ends their relationship and the Cullens leave town.

Bella is left severely depressed and isolates herself for months. She accepts a ride from a biker and the dangerous encounter reminds her of a near-assault where Edward rescued her. She realizes that dangerous activities cause her to hallucinate his image. Her Quileute friend Jacob Black supports her during her slump.

While attending a movie with Bella, Jacob abruptly shows signs of pain and leaves. He cuts his long hair and now exhibits the same Quileute tattoo as leader Sam and the other tribe members. He inexplicably tells Bella to stay away.

When Bella hikes to the meadow that she and Edward often visited, she is confronted by a vampire seeking to avenge Edward's past killing of an enemy vampire. A wolf pack saves her and Bella discovers that Jacob and the other tribe members are werewolves, with Jacob only recently gaining this shapeshifting ability. Their age-old enemies are vampires, though a treaty exists between the Cullens and the tribe.

Edward believes that Bella has killed herself after his clairvoyant abilities adoptive sister Alice has a vision of her jumping off a seaside cliff. Distraught, Edward travels to Italy to ask the vampire council, the Volturi, to end his life. When they refuse, he plans to force their hand by exposing himself as a vampire to humans during a large festival.

Alice and Bella arrive in time to prevent him from doing so. Overjoyed that Bella is alive, he confesses that he left Forks to protect her but promises never to leave her again. Edward defends Bella from the Volturi, who do not allow humans to know about their vampire society.

As the Volturi are about to kill Edward, Bella asks that they kill her instead. Impressed by a human's willingness to sacrifice her life for a vampire, they allow her the choice to be transformed into a vampire instead of dying, convinced when Alice shares a future vision of Bella as a vampire.

After returning to Forks, Bella asks the Cullens to vote on her becoming a vampire. Despite Edward's protestations, almost everyone votes yes.

Jacob reminds Edward that the years-old treaty with Quileute will be broken if any Cullen bites a human, but Bella tells him that it is her choice, not the Cullens'. Edward agrees to let Bella transform into a vampire only if she will marry him, leading to the next movie).

# **The Twilight Saga: Eclipse (2010))** 
    Directed by David Slade and written by Melissa Rosenberg

![wp3503182 (1)](https://github.com/rovelynnazareno/app-dev/assets/169124793/4350b6a0-10e3-4982-89f5-2c974c2d80df)

# Overview
"Eclipse" sees Bella torn between her love for Edward and her growing bond with Jacob as a vampire army gathers in Seattle, threatening the safety of Forks. Bella must confront her feelings and make difficult choices while facing external threats from both vampires and werewolves.

## Plot Summary
In Seattle, Washington, the vampire Victoria attacks a human victim, Riley, so she can begin to create an army of newborns – humans newly transformed into vampires – to get her revenge on an enemy vampire, Edward Cullen, who killed her past lover.

In Forks, Edward and his human girlfriend Bella Swan discuss the complications of becoming an immortal vampire. At 18 years old, one year older than Edward when he transformed, Bella expresses her aversion to the idea of marrying so young.

Edward refuses to turn Bella into a vampire, which she desires, until they are married, his argument being that she should have various human experiences she would otherwise miss. Adding to the turmoil, Bella's childhood friend, a werewolf named Jacob Black, confesses he is in love with her, and forcefully kisses her. Furious, she punches him thereby spraining her hand but forgives him later when he apologizes.

Rosalie tells Bella that she envies her and that choosing to be transformed into a vampire is the wrong choice. She was raped in the streets on her last night as a human. Edward's adoptive sister, Alice Cullen, experiences visions of the future and foresees the newborn vampire army attacking Forks, led by Riley.

As a result, the Cullen vampire family forges an uneasy alliance with the werewolf tribe, and they all decide to strategize and train in defense. During the training, Jasper, Alice's partner, explains to Bella that he was once part of a newborn army and hated himself but he experienced self-worth once he fell in love with Alice. Bella sees the true bond between a mated vampire pair and realizes that spending eternity with Edward is important to her, so she agrees to marry him.

Edward and Bella camp in the mountains to hide her from the bloodthirsty newborns. Jacob overhears them discussing their engagement and takes off, upset. Bella chases him and desperately asks him to kiss her, realizing she has fallen in love with him too. Edward is not upset, as Bella tells him her love for Jacob is not as strong as her love for him.

When Victoria appears, Edward kills her while a werewolf kills Riley; their allies soon destroy the rest of Victoria's army, but Jacob is badly injured during the fight. The Volturi guard, which carries out vampire laws, arrives and finds the Cullens guarding a teenaged newborn who surrendered. The Volturi torture her and prepare to kill her, despite the Cullens' efforts to spare her, revealing their ruthlessness.

When the Volturi note that Bella is still human, she explains the date for her transformation has been set, in the hopes of thwarting their desires to kill her. She visits the injured Jacob to tell him she has chosen to be with Edward, so he reluctantly agrees to stop trying to come between her and Edward.

Bella and Edward go to their meadow, where she tells him that she has decided to do things his way (get married, have sex, then be transformed into a vampire) and that she feels complete in his world. They decide to reveal their engagement to Bella's father.

# **The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn –( Part 1, 2011)** 
    Ddirected by Bill Condon, and author Stephenie Meyerr

![CO8tE7H-twilight-breaking-dawn-wallpapers](https://github.com/rovelynnazareno/app-dev/assets/169124793/a6de6be3-c67a-4b74-a118-4a1da3a0f562)

# Overview
In "Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Bella and Edward's relationship reaches new heights as they get married and embark on a romantic honeymoon. However, their happiness is short-lived when Bella discovers she is pregnant with their half-human, half-vampire child. The film explores Bella's transformation and the challenges of impending parenthood.

## Plot Summary
Several months after the events of the previous film, human Bella Swan and vampire Edward Cullen are getting married. During the reception, werewolf Jacob Black, who had left town upon receiving an invitation to the wedding, returns, much to Bella's delight. They share a dance in the woods, where Bella says that she and Edward plan to consummate their marriage on their honeymoon while she is still human. Jacob becomes furious, fearing that such an act could kill her.

After the wedding, Bella and Edward travel to an island off the coast of Rio de Janeiro for their honeymoon, and they have sex for the first time. Two weeks later, Bella vomits after waking and notices that her period is late. She informs Carlisle Cullen, a medical doctor and Edward's adoptive father, that she believes she is pregnant.

Edward is distraught, as it is highly unlikely a human will survive giving birth to a vampire's baby. He encourages Bella to receive an abortion from Carlisle; she refuses and convinces Edward's sister Rosalie to be her bodyguard.

They fly back home to Forks, Washington, where Jacob rushes to the Cullens' house to find a pale, underweight, and visibly pregnant Bella. He implores her to terminate the pregnancy immediately, but she refuses.

Jacob storms out of the Cullens' residence and meets in the woods with his packmates, including their leader Sam, who soon feels they should kill Bella to ensure her half-vampire child does not harm anyone. Jacob refuses, and he and several other werewolves separate from the pack.

As Bella's pregnancy progresses, her health declines rapidly. She soon realizes the fetus is craving blood, so begins drinking human blood obtained by Carlisle from the hospital, improving her health. As a half-vampire, the fetus's development is far more accelerated than that of a human fetus, and thus Bella's pregnancy progresses at an alarming rate.

Edward's resentment for the baby dissolves when he discovers he can read its thoughts. When Bella suddenly goes into labor, Edward, Jacob, and Rosalie begin performing an emergency C-section while Carlisle is out obtaining blood. The procedure is excruciatingly painful, and Bella falls unconscious, though she wakes to find she has delivered a healthy daughter, whom she names Renesmee (a combination of her mother's name and Edward's mother's name).

Bella's heart suddenly stops, and Jacob desperately attempts CPR. Edward injects Bella's heart with his venom in an attempt to transform her into a vampire, but his action appears to be futile as Bella remains lifeless.

A distraught Jacob decides to kill Renesmee for apparently causing Bella's death; however, when he looks into the baby's eyes, he "imprints" on her: a werewolf phenomenon in which one realizes one's soul-mate. This prevents his pack from killing her as their most absolute law is not to harm anyone who has been imprinted on.

Over the course of two days, though still unconscious, Bella's injuries heal and her figure returns to normal. Finally, her eyes open and are blood-red, signifying that she has become a vampire.

In a post-credits scene, the Volturi, the keepers of vampire law, receive a letter from Carlisle which summarizes Bella and Edward's wedding and her transformation into a vampire. The Volturi bicker about how Carlisle is growing his coven and that the Volturis' dispute with the Cullens is over. However, the Volturi leader mentions that the Cullens still have something he wants.

# **The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn –( Part 2, 2012)** 

![7037719-the-twilight-saga-breaking-dawn-part-2](https://github.com/rovelynnazareno/app-dev/assets/169124793/9a2453b2-ec64-4925-aeab-2dec5ae692bc)

# Overview
The final part, "Breaking Dawn - Part 2," follows Bella's adjustment to vampire life and her efforts to protect her daughter, Renesmee, from the Volturi, a powerful vampire coven. The Cullen family gathers allies to face off against the Volturi in an epic battle that will determine the fate of their family and the entire vampire world.

## Plot Summary
The film continues from the events of the previous film, as Bella, who has just given birth, awakens from her human-to-vampire transformation. After her vampire husband Edward Cullen helps her tame her initial thirst for blood, Bella is introduced to their daughter Renesmee. The rest of the Cullens and Bella's werewolf friend Jacob stay nearby, and when Jacob acts possessively towards Renesmee, Bella learns he has "imprinted" on her, a werewolf phenomenon that makes Jacob and Renesmee soul-mates.

Meanwhile, Bella's father, Charlie, has been trying to contact the Cullens for updates on Bella's health. Carlisle, the Cullen patriarch and a medical doctor, announces that they have to leave Forks, Washington, to protect their identities.

Jacob, desperate not to lose Renesmee, visits Charlie and tells him that Bella is alive and vaguely describes that she has transformed, revealing his wolf form to Charlie to persuade him to stop asking further questions. Charlie goes to the Cullen house to see Bella and meet Renesmee. He accepts that Bella is now recovered but somehow different, though he does not know what has changed or where Renesmee came from, instead accepting she is "adopted".

Several months pass with Carlisle monitoring Renesmee's rapid growth. The vampire Irina spots Renesmee in the forest and mistakenly assumes she is an "immortal child": a type of vampire transformed in childhood who, because it cannot be reasoned with or trained, sucks the blood out of humans uncontrollably. The creation of such children is outlawed by the vampire leadership, the Volturi, and anyone caught with one is executed on the spot. Irina reports the crime to the Volturi.

After Edward's sister Alice, who can see glimpses of the future, experiences a vision of the Volturi and Irina coming to kill the Cullens, she instructs the others to gather as many witnesses as they can to testify that Renesmee is not an immortal child.

As the Volturi serve punishments swiftly, the Cullens and their werewolf allies prepare for a possible battle. Bella soon realizes she has a special ability: a powerful mental shield that had protected her from Edward's mind-reading even when she was human, which she is taught to extend to protect others from vampire superpowers.

The army of the Volturi arrives in Forks, led by Aro, who can read people's minds by touching them. Seeing the Cullens alongside their witnesses and allies, the Volturi hesitate. The Cullens are able to prove to Aro that Renesmee is not an immortal child.

However, the Volturi are eager to subdue the Cullens to forcibly enlist their talented members, so they summarily execute Irina for her mistake to provoke the Cullens into battle. But before an all-out fight breaks out, Alice appears in time to give Aro her vision of the future if fighting ensues.

In Alice's violent vision, Carlisle, Aro, and several others on both sides are killed, including other Volturi, Cullens, and werewolves. Aro, despite being afraid of the vision, still wants to execute Renesmee as she might be a threat to the vampires' secrecy.

Alice reveals their final witness, a Mapuche man from South America, who is a half-human half-vampire, just like Renesmee. He proves that he is not a threat, supporting the notion that Renesmee is not one either. The Volturi unhappily leave, Aro concluding that there will be no battle today.

Back at the Cullen home, Alice glimpses the future, seeing Edward and Bella greeting Jacob and a fully matured Renesmee, also a couple, on a sun-dappled beach. Edward reads Alice's mind and feels relieved that Renesmee has Jacob to protect her.

Alone in their favorite meadow, Bella pushes her mental shield away and finally allows Edward to see into her mind, showing him every moment they have shared together in a montage. They kiss after Bella tells him, "nobody has ever loved anybody as much as I love you", and he romantically responds "with one exception".
